## implement union of polygons 
no draft pushed to the repository. Complex problem, if you're not me and want to work on this, ask me for the existing code.
## fix layers of ports (currently hardcoded to M1) 
Needs small rewrite of technology layermap
## fully implement any_angle_path 
Almost finished, but the start and end points have to be at the correct locations (multiple of the grid). Also perhaps this requires more attention of
trigonometric stuff with integers
